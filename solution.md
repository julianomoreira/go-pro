# Proposed Solution

Based on some research I've done about health insurance, I learned that customer's frustration lies in how health insurance companies think about its users. Most users are illiterate when it comes to understanding how particular services or claims work, and therefore, health insurance companies neglect to provide an experience that can alleviate this pain. 

### Homepage

While the IA of the current website works, I wanted to take a stab at restructuring the site and implement a more welcoming and inviting experience for current and new users. The new homepage design and the new look and feel marry many influences and goals, taking cues from PreferredOne's outdoor, panflets, and advertising, and from a few friends with experience in the health care industry.

The old design doesn't serve its users well in many areas. The design is old and it doesn't communicate trust to its users. It lacks in many aspects from visual design, micro interactions, to feature implementation that could empower users to use the site more often thus allowing users to get stuff done easier.

Nothing in the design should get in the way of helping users consume information (learn, apply, get quotes) they need. Everything in the design should be optimized for desktop and mobile (I'm using flexible grids on this site which sets the foundation for a robust responsive approach in the future).

#### Panel and Login

One of the most important components for current users is the Login to Your Account component. Although the placement of it on the current site isn't suffering, I redesigned it with a few more interactions (not yet implemented) and I moved it down to the main panel area so users don't get lost in finding how to login. I also avoided hiding it under a dropdown since the demographics of health care users in general range from 24-65 years old so making it apparent on the page will help users identify where to login quickly.

I'm using stock photography on the main panel with a photo of a family smiling and holding hands to convey harmony and care. In the panel, I also implemented a big headline with copy inviting users to learn on how to get care. 

#### Find Your Network

As a user myself, I thought it would be nice to look up my doctors and services in my area without having to login every time. Find Your Network component allows users to search for nearby services and doctors without having to enter their login and password. People often forget their password which can be painful for users in general if they have to login to the site to look for something that doesn't require password.

#### Health Plans

I find it hard to find information about a particular health plan for me on the current site. In order to make this process easier, I implemented a better way to visualize, get information about a particular plan, get quotes, and apply from the homepage without hurdles or digging. I separated the plan categories into two containers with a visual cue of what they mean and related CTAs. The buttons (CTA) are well designed in its own respective container, which nicely allows the user to learn or apply instantly from the homepage. 

#### Conversation

Our health is very complex and often hard to understand how to avoid serious problems in the future. Sometimes, a simple question or conversation with experts (doctors, nurses, etc) can really improve my health significantly. This conversation feature was an idea I had to not only improve SEO, and create trust for users, but to be helpful and informative of a particular illness I may be experiencing at the moment or something I should avoid eating for my well-being.
