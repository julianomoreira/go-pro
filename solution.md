# Proposed Solution

### The everlasting problem with healthcare

A few years ago, I was involved in a car accident which has changed my life completely. Throughout such a horror incident, one thing I hoped for was to be able to rely on a system that would aliviate some of the emotional pain I was experiencing at the time. Until then, I confess I was health-care-system iliterate; I had never bothered to learn how my plan worked and the tricks involved in getting proper cover with my health while under an affordable plan. As a designer going through the painful process of being severally injured, I thought I could rely on my health insurance's website to at least inform me of some of costs involved and what I could do under my budget in case my plan didn't cover. To say the least, my online experience was just as bad as my offline experience, and in this exercise I intend to address some, not all, of the concerns existing in major health insurance's website.
