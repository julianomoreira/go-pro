# Moar Better - GoPro Design Exercise 

## About Me

My name is Juliano Moreira Dasilva. I'm a designer and coder living in Minneapolis, MN. I love to make stuff feel easy and simple. I craft easy-to-use interfaces for the web. I'm constantly open to new areas of learning and growth who loves coding and shipping products for the web. I'm a big advocate of designers learning to code. I'm dedicated to bridging the existing gap in large teams between designers and developers (and often PMs) thus helping the team iterate, ship, and learn much faster from users. I believe learning from users has the most value, and a team that is well-connected and share the same passion throughout the development process can shine and create truly delightful experiences. I believe empathy, compassion, and emotion are the highest touch points of any web experience.

I worked and founded a startup, [Cympel](http://www.cympel.com), raised money and joined an accelerator program, [Straight Shot](http://straightshot.co), in Omaha, NE. I understand the value of going lean for startups. Iâ€™m accostumed to working in a fast-paced environment. As community leader of [Minnesota Web Design Group](http://www.meetup.com/mn-web-design/), I embrace the importance of motivating teams and coordinating enterprise-wide design and tech activities.

## Tools

### CSS/HTML/Javascript 

I love Cascading Style Sheets. I love how simple it is. I love the syntax. It's so easy to use. It's a tool that every designer should be comfortable with. Designing for the web is about writing lean code, that's flexible and has as little redundancies as possible. It's about writing clean, organized, and easy-understand code for teams across an entire organization; it's about writing code that works yesterday, today, and tomorrow with no or very little maintenance required. 

The pages in this exercise were hand-coded using Sublime Text 2 with a few awesome plugins, and the code is being tracked in Git and Github. I'm a strong advocate of using methodologies such as [BEM](http://bem.info), [SMACSS](http://smacss.com), and [OOCSS](http://oocss.org), specially for big organizations where communication and agile development are not their strong suit given the size and complexity of large teams.

### Paper, Photoshop, Sketch

I used paper, Photoshop, Sketch, and a browser from concept to design. I'm new to Sketch so I'm still transitioning from Photoshop on a per project basis and where it makes the most sense. I don't believe in using only one tool for the job and I'm 
very open to new areas of learning.
